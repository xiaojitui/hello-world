Quote –
“What I cannot create, I do not understand.” — Richard Feynman
This quote captures a core principle of Richard Feynman’s philosophy: real understanding comes from building and experimenting, not just observing or memorizing.
For me, this isn’t just a quote—it’s a mindset I strongly believe in and actively practice. True understanding comes from hands-on experience. If you truly understand a system, concept, or idea, you should be able to recreate it, build it, or explain it from the ground up. Memorizing facts isn’t enough; learning happens when you actively create, test, and engage with the material.
I wanted to share this here because the rapid growth of AI techniques strongly reflects this idea. AI models are evolving at an incredible pace, and simply knowing about them is no longer sufficient. To truly understand them, we need to work with them—build, experiment, and challenge our assumptions.
In short: don’t just know it—make it, try it, test it. That’s how real understanding is formed.

In Summary
•	GPT-5.2 is OpenAI’s most capable model yet for professional and enterprise use, with notable reasoning, coding and long-context performance gains. Business Insider
•	It was released partly in response to competitive pressure from Google Gemini 3, underlining an intensifying AI race. Reuters
•	Benchmark results and pricing shifts show each platform has advantages depending on task type — with GPT-5.2 leaning toward structured reasoning workflows and Gemini toward broad multimodal context. Technology.org
•	For businesses, this new generation of models means deeper AI integration across workflows, productivity gains, and expanding strategic AI use cases — alongside challenges around cost, labor changes, and model selection.
•	GPDVal - GDPVal measures AI performance on economically valuable, real-world tasks drawn from 44 professional occupations across 9 major industries that contribute significantly to U.S. GDP. These are based on actual work products and judged by experienced human professionals. 
o	Strong performance on the GDPVal benchmark (real-world professional tasks): GPT-5.2 Thinking achieved a 70.9% “wins or ties” score on GDPVal — a benchmark evaluating knowledge work across 44 occupations — significantly outperforming GPT-5.1’s ~38.8% and matching or exceeding professional human levels on most tasks like spreadsheet modeling, presentations, and other economically valuable work outputs. It also produces GDPVal outputs over 11× faster and at under 1% of traditional expert cost.

# GDPVal tasks are not simple quiz questions — they resemble deliverable-based work items typical in knowledge work, such as: OpenAI+1
•	📄 Documents & Reports
Legal briefs, regulatory memos, financial reports, compliance documentation. OpenAI
•	📊 Data-Driven Artifacts
Spreadsheets, financial models, staffing schedules, market analyses, chart creation. GDPval
•	📈 Presentations & Slides
Slide decks summarizing analysis, recommendations, or project plans. GDPval
•	🧠 Technical and Engineering Outputs
Engineering diagrams or design summaries (e.g., CAD deliverables and engineering testing plans). OpenAI
•	💬 Customer & Stakeholder Communications
Synthesizing support conversations or creating professional communications. GDPval
•	📷 Multimedia and Visual Content
Tasks may include graphics, diagrams, or visual deliverables in addition to text. OpenAI
